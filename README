Mod_spambot is an Apache plugin that monitors the data being downloaded from a
server thus stopping spambots and unwanted mirrors from copying a site's data.
When the number of requests for a client exceeds a preset level no more
downloads are allowed for a preset time. When this happens the client received
a tailored message informing them of what has happened. Many of the features can
be tailored to the needs of the webmaster to help to prevent false positives and
to customise the definition of a client to be blacklisted.

Mod_spambot comes from code written for an old website I ran. My ISP
blacklisted the site for being too "popular". Doing research that the ISP
couldn't be bothered to do I discovered that unwanted crawlers were bombarding
the sites with requests. The ISP blamed me and threatened to take the site down,
and frankly it was too much time, that I didn't have, to find a new ISP. Since
these spiders are not real users, or Google, I had to put in code to stop them,
mod_spambot was borne out of that need.  

As a useful side-effect, mod_spambot will help the system when it suffers a
DoS attack.

If a client, that has not been whitelisted, downloads more than 100 pages in an
hour they are blacklisted unless there has been more than 10 minutes between
the downloads. All the figures are configurable - those values are the default.
HEAD requests are not counted.

The algorithm is simple, but surprisingly effective. No doubt it will improve
with time and your feedback. Please send any suggestions to njh@bandsman.co.uk.

Q1. I only want mod_spambot on with one vhost how do I do that?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a few lines from a sample httpd.conf to do that:

<IfModule mod_spambot.c>
	SpamBot Off
</IfModule>

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName foo1.bar
	DocumentRoot "/var/www/foo1.bar"
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName foo2.bar
	DocumentRoot "/var/www/foo2.bar"

	<Directory /var/www/foo2.bar>
		<IfModule mod_spambot.c>
			SpamBot On
			SpamBotDatabaseFile /tmp/spambot.db
			SpamBotDebugFile /tmp/spambot.dbg
			# SpamBotRedirectPath /err.html
			SpamBotWhiteList 127.0.0.1
			SpamBotWhiteList 192.168.1.2
		</IfModule>

		AllowOverride All
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Q2. My system doesn't have in_addr_t so mod_spambot fails to compile
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Older linux distributions did not have in_addr_t. To compile mod_spambot
on your system enable the following line that is towards the top of the file:
	typedef	unsigned	int	in_addr_t;

This line is required for older Linuxes as well as Darwin.
